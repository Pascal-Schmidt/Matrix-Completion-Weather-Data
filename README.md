# Matrix-Completion-Weather-Data

- This project was an in-class Kaggle competition where we had to predict missing data for a time series weather data set. 
- More detailed information about the project and also the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stat440-19-module2).
- With a combination of interpolation and linear regression models, our team managed to finish **1st place** on the private leaderboard.
- Overall, our strategy can be summarised in figuring out for what missing data entries it made sense to use interpolation, and for which ones it made sense to use regression models.
